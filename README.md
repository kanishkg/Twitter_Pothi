# Twitter_Pothi
Task Using the Twitter Streaming API to track a given keyword and maintaining a cache of most recently used words. The words in cache are scored as following: • Every time a word is seen, it’s score goes up by 1. • Every minute the word is not seen, it’s score goes down by 1. This scoring is done every 30 seconds. Once the score of a word falls below 0, it is pruned from the cache. New entries in the cache have score 1. If the cache has reached maximum size, words with score 0 can be dropped to make space for new entries. Input keyword (program prompts on the command line) Output After starting, every 1 minute, program prints the words in cache with score > 1.
